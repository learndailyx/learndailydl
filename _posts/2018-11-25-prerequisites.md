<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This post is to know things before starting to learn Deep Learning. We will start from very basic things and some important links to learn the prerequisites. Before starting this course I recommend the following things to be completed. Otherwise, you might feel lost in the middle of the course. It is recommended to complete in order to keep the interest of the subject. I have not explained any of the concepts here because these topics are quite matured topics and experts have explained these things in a very unique way. So i have listed some good resources for understanding each of the topics in a very fun way with practical knowledge. Go through the entire set of prerequisite for atleast a 1.5-2 weeks (20-25 hours) so that you are comfortable looking into probability, linear algebra and any coding jargons discussed in the course.

### Prerequisites:

- Be comfortable atleast in one language preferably in [C/C++, Java or Python](#become-comfortable-in-languages).(Course will be based on Python) [**](#note)

- Basics of calculus. You just need to know differentiation only to some extent. (Basic Operations).

- Basics of Probability.

- Basics of Linear Algebra.


##### Become Comfortable in languages.
* C/C++ - I would recommend to start with C++ which is an advance version of C. This is the best one stop solution for understanding C++ from zero to moderate level C++ guy/gal. [FreecodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y).

* Python - Python is an interpreted language which doesn't require any compilation. So for understanding this language to a greater extent follow the course from freecodecamp. [FreecodeCamp Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw&t=1s)

##### Practicing languages everyday.
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The best online platform to practice languages everyday is <a href="https://www.codingame.com/">CodingGame</a> where you can battle with other people for a time period of 15mins. And its my personal experience that this kind of battle gives you a better understanding of the basic operations, I/O and In-built libraries of these languages. Try to participate atleast 3 battle every day for atleast a month. And please donot try multiple languages as you might not have a concrete understanding of any particular language. I would recommend Python as the language is easy to understand. Later you can pick either Java or C++ for getting the flavour of a compiled language for the same Problem statement.

##### Learn Probability
As there are plethora of good contents regarding this topic, I will be listing a stepwise approach to understand the concepts of Probabilty and Statistics. 

* Step 1 : Know the reasons of learning probabilty and statisctics for machine learning and deep learning and some of its concepts. [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@rohitrpatil/basic-linear-algebra-for-deep-learning-f537825b278f) by Rohit Patel.

* (Optional) One Stop solution for probability topics. [Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/probability-statistics-for-data-science-series-83b94353ca48) by Ankit Rathi.

* For more better understanding with the some problem solving skills. Follow the courses for probability and statistics @[Khan_Academy Course List](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) 


##### Linear Algebra
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The linear algebra is a very basic subject which is included in any high school syllabus. But to understand and know the significance of each and every concept in Linear algebra i recommend this video series where it has explained each property in a very unique and fun way. This was also included as a part of <a href="https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months">Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months</a> Siraj's Open Source Course syllabus.

###### Note
<sup>** - I will try to implement the course lessons (codebase) in all threee languages for your better understanding and support in different languages. But its a future enhancement of the entire course.</sup>
